<li><b>U.S. Treasury -</b>&nbsp;Treasury bonds, often referred to as “Treasuries”, are debt instruments issued by the US government (and as such are exempt from state and local taxes). Backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, they are considered to be the safest of all investments.</li>
<li><b>Agency -&nbsp;</b>Agency bonds, commonly known as "agencies", are debt securities issued by US government sponsored agencies for public purposes, such as increasing home ownership or supporting small businesses. Because of their government affiliation, agency bonds are considered to be safe. However, each issuer has unique features as to potential risks and tax benefits.</li>
<li><b>Municipal -&nbsp;</b>Municipal bonds, or “munis”, are debt securities issued by state or local governments to finance public projects. Interest income is typically free from federal income taxes, and if held by an investor in the state of issuance, may be exempt from state and local taxes as well.</li>
<li><b>Corporate - </b>Many&nbsp;public and private companies issue bonds to help finance their ongoing operations. These bonds typically offer higher yields than municipal or U.S. Treasury securities, although they may entail a greater risk of default. Because the interest they pay is fully taxable, corporates may be a sound choice for IRAs or other tax-deferred accounts.</li>
<li><b>High-yield -&nbsp;</b>Bonds with ratings below BBB are often referred to as “junk” bonds. These bonds typically provide higher yields than investment-grade bonds, but have a higher risk of default.</li>
<li><b><a href="/what-we-offer/our-accounts/brokered-cds">Brokered CDs</a> -&nbsp;</b>Brokered certificates of deposit (“CDs”) are similar to bank CDs, with the added benefit that they can be bought and sold in the&nbsp;secondary market penalty-free. These securities are FDIC insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each ownership category. Brokered CDs from multiple banks can be held in a brokerage account, increasing your total FDIC coverage.</li>
